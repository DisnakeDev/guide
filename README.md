Welcome! The purpose of this guide is to make your journey with `disnake` easier, whether you're an experienced
developer just getting into coding Discord bots, or an advanced bot developer who has decided to proceed with `disnake`
as their library of choice.

The concept we will be going over, include:

-   How to get started on working with bots;
-   How to create and organize commands, using cogs/extensions;
-   Working with databases (such as [`sqlite`][sqlite-docs] and [`mongodb (motor)`][motor-docs]);
-   Using the [`AutoShardedClient`](https://disnake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#disnake.AutoShardedClient) class
    to shard your bot;
-   A plethora of examples with popular topics along with in-depth explanation, and much more!

[sqlite-docs]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
[motor-docs]: https://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

This guide will showcase the various features and events that our library has, while giving you an idea of how these
functions work together as well as how the syntax looks in production.
